# Using CSS ZenGarden to learn CSS3

This is a work project to learn CSS3 using the [CSS ZenGarden](http://csszengarden.com) html.

## `{less}`
For this project I'm planning on using `{less}`, which I guess is a CSS preprocessor. I'll probably eventually precompile all my `.less` files to `.css` but while I'm deveolping I'll be breaking the ZenGarden rules by including the `less.js` script in the HTML.
